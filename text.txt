Overall, the analysis of article text was done using web scraping, text embedding with OAI's text-embedding-3-large model, k-means clustering for topic grouping, and geographic entity extraction for location analysis

General process:
Web scraping was done with concurrent processing, Requests, and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
The embedding process used OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model (3072 dimensions) with batch processing
The clustering process used k-means clustering with optimal k determination via silhouette analysis
The geographic analysis used GPT-4o to extract countries and cities from article titles and map them to continents

How K-means Clustering Works
K-means clustering groups articles into k clusters based on similarity in high-dimensional embedding space:

1. Text to Vectors: Each article's text (title + content) is converted into a 3072-dimensional vector using OpenAI's embedding model, capturing semantic meaning
2. Optimal K Selection: The elbow method and silhouette analysis determine the optimal number of clusters by testing different k values and selecting the one with the highest silhouette score
3. Cluster Assignment: K-means algorithm assigns each article to the cluster with the nearest centroid in embedding space
4. Cluster Analysis: Each cluster is analyzed for diversity across news sources, regions, and topics

How Geographic Analysis Works
GPT-4o extracts geographic entities from article titles and organizes them by continent:

1. Entity Extraction: GPT-4o processes article titles to identify countries and cities mentioned, handling multilingual text
2. Geographic Mapping: Cities are mapped to their countries, and countries are mapped to their continents
3. Batch Processing: Multiple articles are processed simultaneously for efficiency
4. Data Organization: Results are structured by country with mention counts, article details, and associated cities

This approach effectively groups articles by topic similarity and provides geographic insights into news coverage patterns across different regions.
